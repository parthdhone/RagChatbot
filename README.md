# 🤖 Realtime RAG-based Chatbot using ChromaDB, Mistral (GGUF), and Gemini API

A full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot system powered by **ChromaDB**, **Mistral 7B (GGUF)** for local LLM inference, and **Gemini API** for document summarization. The project features a custom HTML/CSS frontend with support for dynamic PDF upload and chatbot querying.

## 💡 Features

- 📄 PDF ingestion and semantic chunking
- 🧠 ChromaDB as vector database (persistent)
- 💬 Local inference using **Mistral-7B-Instruct** `.gguf` via llama.cpp / ctransformers
- ☁️ Gemini API for PDF summarization during upload
- 🌐 FastAPI backend with REST endpoint
- 🎨 Custom HTML/CSS frontend interface
- 📎 Dynamic PDF Upload and Question Answering

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/realtime-rag-chatbot.git
cd realtime-rag-chatbot


2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

python -m venv rag_env
rag_env\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# source rag_env/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac

3. Install Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt


🧠 Ingest and Index PDF Manuals

python backend/ingest.py

This stores embeddings in persistent ChromaDB located in backend/chromadb.

🚀 Run the FastAPI Backend

uvicorn backend.app:app --reload

Visit FastAPI docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

Run the Frontend (HTML/CSS)

Simply open frontend/index.html in your browser.

You can serve it with a static server like VSCode Live Server or Python's HTTP server:

cd frontend
python -m http.server 5500

🔍 How it Works
RAG Pipeline
🧩 Embedding: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from Sentence Transformers

📚 Storage: ChromaDB (persistent vector store)

🤖 LLM: mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 in .gguf format via ctransformers

💬 Response: Top-k relevant chunks + query passed to LLM for generation

📎 Gemini API: Used to summarize uploaded PDFs before ingestion

📤 PDF Upload + Gemini Summarization
Upload a PDF using the Upload Button in the frontend.

Gemini API extracts and summarizes content.

Summary is embedded and added to the ChromaDB vector store.



🧰 Tech Stack
Component----	Tool / Library
Embeddings---	sentence-transformers (MiniLM)
Vector DB---	ChromaDB
LLM Inference---	ctransformers with .gguf Mistral LLM
Summarization---	Google Gemini API
Backend API	FastAPI
Frontend---	HTML + CSS

📦 Dependencies

📌 Note: You must manually download the .gguf Mistral model and place it inside the models/ folder.


❓ Sample Queries

“How to pair Realme Buds with phone?”

“What is the voltage range supported by ABB device?”

“How to reset a Dell Latitude laptop?”

🛠️ Troubleshooting
✅ Make sure ChromaDB directory exists before querying.

✅ Verify Mistral .gguf model path is correct in chain.py.

✅ Check tokenizer and generator are properly loaded with correct model path.

✅ If UI freezes, check browser console for network errors.
